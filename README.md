Application for booking tickets for movies

School project for booking tickets for movies.

Uses Maven, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Hibernate/JPA, MySql, Flyway. There are several bugs/bad practices which I hope to resolve in the near future. Info for MySql connection can be found in application.properties.

/createAdmin page is out of spring security's scope, so an user can be created with a hashed password by accessing the URL
